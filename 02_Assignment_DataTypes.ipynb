    "This week, we'll dig into working with data types in Python. Next, we'll start to write some very basic expressions that can evaluate that data for us. In the process, we'll also unpack the power of methods to perform common tasks on the data whether they be numbers or text. Finally, we'll rewrite a bit of Shakespeare using methods and figure out how long until we can retire.\n",
